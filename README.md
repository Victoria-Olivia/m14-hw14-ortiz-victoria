## The Other Two Bootstrap Components Used:

### I used Bootstrapâ€™s card component, including the classes .card, .card-img-top, .card-body, .card-title, and .card-text. I also applied the shadow utility class to add subtle depth and visual emphasis to the card layout.

### Additionally, I used a Bootstrap button, utilizing the .btn and .btn-warning classes. The button links to an external website and includes the utility class .mt-3 to create consistent spacing from surrounding elements.
